# by Reference

Some people said that the pointer and reference are absolutely different things.

But I have a question:
   if so, how to implement the reference mechanism ? ...


----> This experiment has proven that:

A reference is a pointer in nature,
    but compiler illustrate the reference's address as the value stored in ref_a,
       while do the same thing on pointer get the actual address of pointer.

Apparently, this is in a very shallow degree explanation,
    especially without the class's view on this matter.
