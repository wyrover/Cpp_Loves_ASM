# Part 4: string array as well as string class

how is string initialized in C++.

Today we'll going into the details of initialization.

Also, by using disassembly.

	But, eh
		The Debug process is not easy, 
			which result in re-debug many times,
			  and thus the address of machine code arranged is changeable.
		So, if you see the great "leap" of the memory address, 
		    don't be surprised, take it easy ~  :)
			

Do you want to explore the secret inside it?

Let's Go !!!
