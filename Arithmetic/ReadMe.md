# Part 2: Arithmetic Operations
Purpose: just want to show the result of C++ program's compiled codes 
These operations including
   add, subtract, multiply, division, get modulus
  is demonstrated in the C++ source file with its compiled assembly codes,
  which ranged from integer to floating-point number.

# To tell the truth,
  I have little knowledge towards floating-point number's operations
  So, just not be panic about it, later I will illustrate this in great details.
  
# Have fun.
